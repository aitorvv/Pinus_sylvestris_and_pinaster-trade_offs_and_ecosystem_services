There were also significant differences in BD between the tissues (heartwood{\textgreater}sapwood{\textgreater}bark), and the BD was higher in Q. petraea than in Q. pyrenaica. Both \%C and BD varied along the stem. • Conclusion More accurate estimates of carbon contents were obtained by using specific values for different heights and anatomical parts, than by using single values. © INRA/Springer-Verlag France 2012.},

	abstract = {Most industrial countries have implemented national forest inventories (NFIs) with systematic and permanent sample plots. These data are principally an excellent database for carbon accounting at tree-level. The purpose of this study was to establish tree-level functions for predicting aboveground biomass carbon of European beech. In a subsequent step these functions were applied to inventory data and the error of the predictions was assessed. The regression equations were based on a model data set of 116 trees of beech (Fagus sylvatica) sampled in four climatic regions of the western German state North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW). The tree parameters diameter at breast height (d), tree height (h) and as a proxy for climatic conditions the altitude (alt) were used as predictor variables. The estimated mean relative prediction error of the favoured d–h and d–h–alt models at tree-level was 16.7 and 15.7\%, respectively. The carbon content of wood ranged between 48.9 and 50.7\%. Beech forest in NRW stored on average 120MgCha−1 in the aboveground biomass (excluding understory and reserved beeches). The total prediction error was less than ±2\%. Based on such a high precision and due to the fact that the identical inventory plots are remeasured, stock changes in the order of 1\% can be detected. The main uncertainty arises from the sampling error of the inventory grid. Comparing the predicted increment and the potential harvest during the next decade suggests that the carbon stock stabilises within the range of uncertainty. Further, we predicted the biomass of the 116 sample trees with six published, mostly stand-specific functions. The relative mean prediction error of the calculated aboveground carbon content was about ±15–32\% of the observed values at tree-level and ±10\% over all sample trees. But most of the predictions were systematically biased. This illustrates the need to use regional functions based on a large model data set.},

	abstract = {Understanding biological processes in forests is necessary to orientate ecosystem management towards potential C sequestration. To achieve this, information is required about changes in forest biomass C pools, including the stem components (bark, sapwood and heartwood). This study aimed to determine whether there are differences in C concentration in axial and radial directions within stem biomass in Pinus nigra, Pinus pinaster and Pinus sylvestris. Wood samples from a permanent plantation in northern Spain were examined for C concentration and wood bulk density. The results showed that C concentration was higher in heartwood than in sapwood in the three species. Pinus spp. sapwood C concentration increased along the stem, while the C concentration in heartwood tissue showed the opposite behavior. In bark, Pinus pinaster showed a decreasing trend, in contrast to Pinus nigra and Pinus sylvestris, where higher values were found at the base and top of the stem. Finally, wood bulk density decreased in heartwood, sapwood and bark areas when stem height increased. Estimating C content taking into account different anatomical parts and heights is important in considering the specificity of the different parts because of their potential commercial or ecological use in forest ecosystems.},

	abstract = {From analysis of published global site biomass data (n = 136) from primary forests, we discovered (i) the world's highest known total biomass carbon density (living plus dead) of 1,867 tonnes carbon per ha (average value from 13 sites) occurs in Australian temperate moist Eucalyptus regnans forests, and (ii) average values of the global site biomass data were higher for sampled temperate moist forests (n = 44) than for sampled tropical (n = 36) and boreal (n = 52) forests (n is number of sites per forest biome). Spatially averaged Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change biome default values are lower than our average site values for temperate moist forests, because the temperate biome contains a diversity of forest ecosystem types that support a range of mature carbon stocks or have a long land-use history with reduced carbon stocks. We describe a framework for identifying forests important for carbon storage based on the factors that account for high biomass carbon densities, including (i) relatively cool temperatures and moderately high precipitation producing rates of fast growth but slow decomposition, and (ii) older forests that are often multiaged and multilayered and have experienced minimal human disturbance. Our results are relevant to negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change regarding forest conservation, management, and restoration. Conserving forests with large stocks of biomass from deforestation and degradation avoids significant carbon emissions to the atmosphere, irrespective of the source country, and should be among allowable mitigation activities. Similarly, management that allows restoration of a forest's carbon sequestration potential also should be recognized.},

However, coarse approximations of woody tissue C (e.g., 50\%) remain commonplace in forest C estimation and reporting protocols, despite leading to substantial errors in forest C estimates. Here, we describe the Global Woody Tissue Carbon Concentration Database (GLOWCAD): a database containing 3,676 individual records of woody tissue C concentrations from 864 tree species. Woody tissue C concentration data—i.e., the mass of C per unit dry mass—were obtained from live and dead woody tissues from 130 peer-reviewed sources published between 1980–2020. Auxiliary data for each observation include tissue type, as well as decay class and size characteristics for dead wood. In GLOWCAD, 1,242 data points are associated with geographic coordinates, and are therefore presented alongside 46 standardized bioclimatic variables extracted from climate databases. GLOWCAD represents the largest available woody tissue C concentration database, and informs studies on forest C estimation, as well as analyses evaluating the extent, causes, and consequences of inter- and intraspecific variation in wood chemical traits.},

Most C estimation protocols utilize a default dead wood CF of 50\%, but live tree studies suggest this value is an over-estimate. Here, we compile and analyze a global database of dead wood CFs in trees, showing that dead wood CFs average 48.5\% across forests, deviating significantly from 50\%, and varying systematically among biomes, taxonomic divisions, tissue types, and decay classes. Utilizing data-driven dead wood CFs in tropical forests alone may correct systematic overestimates in dead wood C stocks of {\textasciitilde}3.0 Pg C: an estimate approaching nearly the entire dead wood C pool in the temperate forest biome. We provide for the first time, robust empirical dead wood CFs to inform global forest C estimation.},

Nowadays, the multicriteria issue enjoys a relatively sound tradition in forest management. However, the consideration of several stakeholders, which requires the formulation of management models within a collective decision-making setting, is not that advanced. This paper aims to provide a critical overview of forestry case studies that have been published in primary journals and that deal with multiple criteria and several stakeholders. Based on this overview, some highlights of the most promising methods were obtained, and recommendations for the fruitful use of these combined methodologies for dealing with numerous types of forest management problems are provided.},

	abstract = {Technological development gives forest companies opportunities to maintain competitiveness in the highly cost-sensitive market for forest products. However, no previous studies have examined the technological development decisions made by forest companies or the support tools used when making them. We therefore aimed to describe and analyze 1) the processes used when making such decisions, 2) the associated decision situations, and 3) the use of and need for decision support tools in these processes, with a harwarder concept as case. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with respondents from six forestry organizations. Two theoretical frameworks were used to analyze the interviews, one for unstructured decision processes and one for decision situations. The respondents’ descriptions of their decision processes were consistent with those observed in other industries, and it was shown that decision-making could potentially be improved by investing more resources into diagnosing the problem at hand. The main objective in decision-making was to maximize economic criteria while satisfying threshold requirements relating to criteria such as operator well-being, soil rutting, and wood value. When facing large uncertainties, interviewees preferred to gather data through operational trials and/or scientific studies. If confronted with large uncertainties that could not be reduced, they proceeded with development only if the potential gains exceeded the estimated uncertainties, and implemented innovations in a stepwise manner. These results indicate a need for greater use of existing decision-support tools such as problem-structuring methods to enable more precise diagnoses, simulations to better understand new innovations, and optimization to better evaluate their theoretical large-scale potential.},

It has been in the focus of tree improvement since many decades. Breeding programmes were initiated with selection of plus trees, establishment of seed orchards and progeny testing in nearly all countries where this species is of economic importance. Today these programmes are developed very differently. There are countries with advanced programmes for improvement of Scots pine and others were such programmes were stopped in the last years. In this chapter the situation of breeding of Scots pine is described for different European countries. Short overviews are given about the distribution of Scots pine, its genetic diversity, the wood production and the state of forest reproductive material of this species in Europe.},

	abstract = {Submediterranean forests are considered an ecotone between Mediterranean and Eurosiberian ecosystems, and are very sensitive to global change. A decline of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and a related expansion of oak species (Quercus spp.) have been reported in the Spanish Pre-Pyrenees. Although this has been associated with increasing drought stress, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, and suitable monitoring protocols are lacking. The aim of this study is to bring insight into the physiological mechanisms anticipating selective decline of the pines, with particular focus on carbon and water relations. For this purpose, we performed a sampling campaign covering two growing seasons in a mixed stand of P. sylvestris and Quercus subpyrenaica E.H del Villar. We sampled seasonally twig xylem and soil for water isotope composition (δ18O and δ2H), leaves for carbon isotope composition (δ13C) and stems to quantify non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) concentration, and measured water potential and leaf gas exchange. The ﬁrst summer drought was severe for both species, reaching low predawn water potential (−2.2 MPa), very low stomatal conductance (12 ± 1.0 mmol m−2 s−1) and near-zero or even negative net photosynthesis, particularly in P. sylvestris (−0.6 ± 0.34 μmol m−2 s−1 in oaks, −1.3 ± 0.16 μmol m−2 s−1 in pines). Hence, the tighter stomatal control and more isohydric strategy of P. sylvestris resulted in larger limitations on carbon assimilation, and this was also reﬂected in carbon storage, showing twofold larger total NSC concentration in oaks than in pines (7.8 ± 2.4\% and 4.0 ± 1.3\%, respectively). We observed a faster recovery of predawn water potential after summer drought in Q. subpyrenaica than in P. sylvestris (−0.8 MPa and −1.1 MPa, respectively). As supported by the isotopic data, this was probably associated with a deeper and more reliable water supply in Q. subpyrenaica. In line with these short-term observations, we found a more pronounced negative eﬀect of steadily increasing drought stress on longterm growth in pines compared with oaks. All these observations confer evidence of early warning of P. sylvestris decline and indicate the adaptive advantage of Q. subpyrenaica in the area.},

Here, we use 32 triplets of mature and fully stocked monocultures and mixed stands of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) located along a productivity and water availability gradient through Europe to examine how mixing modifies the stand structure in terms of stand density, horizontal tree distribution pattern, vertical stand structure, size distribution pattern, and variation in tree morphology. We further analyze how site conditions modify these aspects of stand structure. For this typical mixture of a light demanding and shade tolerant species we show that (i) mixing significantly increases many aspects of structural heterogeneity compared with monocultures, (ii) mixing effects such as an increase of stand density and diversification of vertical structure and tree morphology are caused by species identity (additive effects) but also by species interactions (multiplicative effects), and (iii) superior heterogeneity of mixed stands over monocultures can increase from dry to moist sites. We discuss the implications for analyzing the productivity, for modelling and for the management of mixed species stands.},

They are commonly applied in the United States but they are rarely used in European forest management yet. One of the few exceptions is the simulator SILVA, which is presented in this paper. The underlying equations of this simulator are developed from a set of more than 155,000 tree observations, including the species Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), Silver fir (Abies alba Mill.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Common beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Mattuschka) Liebl.). These basic model equations are presented together with respective parameter values, derived from the aforesaid data set. The benefits of SILVA for forest practice, research, and education are demonstrated with three exemplary applications. Evaluation in terms of biological plausibility, validation, and practical use of the implemented software is presented, which shows that: (1) biological principles could be represented without explicitly being implemented, and (2) the simulation results are very close to independent observations as far as the range of parameterized site conditions is not exceeded. Furthermore, possible implications of changing conditions or an application of the model across a wider geographical range are discussed with special reference to the ongoing process of parameterization.},

	abstract = {The temperate, humid climate and nutrient-rich soils in the pre-alpine areas of southern Bavaria represent conditions where European beech and Norway spruce come out with rather equal above ground biomass production when cultivated in pure stands. In order to reveal the effect of mixture we established 37 experimental plots in even-aged pure and mixed stands of Norway spruce and European beech covering an age span of 37–155 years. The site conditions ranged from warm, dry and base-rich to cool, wet and acidic sites. The ratio of above ground biomass growth of Norway spruce in relation to European beech decreases from 1.14:1 in the monocultures to 1.04:1 in the mixed stands. The mixing of spruce and beech results in a mutual stimulation of biomass production and acceleration of size growth. Together both species produce up to 59\% more above ground biomass than the neighboring pure stands. On average the overyielding amounts to 21\% in the case of Norway spruce and 37\% in the case of European beech. A total of 67\% out of the plots indicate overyielding and 57\% transgressive overyielding. In mixed stands both species’ tree sizes are significantly ahead of the corresponding pure stands. Facilitation of spruce and competitive reduction of beech yields mutualism with respect to growth on tree and stand level. Consequences for analyzing and modeling interspecific competition and for silvicultural prescriptions are discussed. Ecological implications of the mixing effect on the occurrence and stability of natural and man-made mixed stands of spruce and beech are considered.},

	abstract = {Past failures of monocultures, caused by wind-throw or insect damages, and ongoing climate change currently strongly stimulate research into mixed-species stands. So far, the focus has mainly been on combinations of species with obvious complementary functional traits. However, for any generalization, a broad overview of the mixing reactions of functionally different tree species in different mixing proportions, patterns and under different site conditions is needed, including assemblages of species with rather similar demands on resources such as light. Here, we studied the growth of Scots pine and oak in mixed versus monospecific stands on 36 triplets located along a productivity gradient across Europe, reaching from Sweden to Spain and from France to Georgia. The set-up represents a wide variation in precipitation (456–1250 mm year−1), mean annual temperature (6.7–11.5 °C) and drought index by de Martonne (21–63 mm °C−1). Stand inventories and increment cores of trees stemming from 40- to 132-year-old, fully stocked stands on 0.04–0.94-ha-sized plots provided insight into how species mixing modifies stand growth and structure compared with neighbouring monospecific stands. On average, the standing stem volume was 436 and 360 m3 ha−1 in the monocultures of Scots pine and oak, respectively, and 418 m3 ha−1 in the mixed stands. The corresponding periodical annual volume increment amounted to 10.5 and 9.1 m3 ha−1 year−1 in the monocultures and 10.5 m3 ha−1 year−1 in the mixed stands. Scots pine showed a 10\% larger quadratic mean diameter (p {\textless} 0.05), a 7\% larger dominant diameter (p {\textless} 0.01) and a 9\% higher growth of basal area and volume in mixed stands compared with neighbouring monocultures. For Scots pine, the productivity advantages of growing in mixture increased with site index (p {\textless} 0.01) and water supply (p {\textless} 0.01), while for oak they decreased with site index (p {\textless} 0.01). In total, the superior productivity of mixed stands compared to monocultures increased with water supply (p {\textless} 0.10). Based on 7843 measured crowns, we found that in mixture both species, but especially oak, had significantly wider crowns (p {\textless} 0.001) than in monocultures. On average, we found relatively small effects of species mixing on stand growth and structure. Scots pine benefiting on rich, and oak on poor sites, allows for a mixture that is productive and most likely climate resistant all along a wide ecological gradient. We discuss the potential of this mixture in view of climate change.},

	abstract = {The Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) is a distance-independent, individual-tree forest growth model widely used in the United States to support management decisionmaking. Stands are the basic projection unit, but the spatial scope can be many thousands of stands. The temporal scope is several hundred years at a resolution of 5–10 years. Projections start with a summary of current conditions evident in the input inventory data. FVS contains a self-calibration feature that uses measured growth rates to modify predictions for local conditions. Component models predict the growth and mortality of individual trees, and extensions to the base model represent disturbance agents including insects, pathogens, and fire. The component models differ depending on the geographic region represented by regionally specific model variants. The differences are due to data availability and the applicability of existing models. The model supports specification of management rules in the input, such as thinning if density is too high. The rules can be extended to represent other factors. For example, the effect of climate change on stand development by entering rules that specify how growth and mortality will change in response to changing climate. Applications range from development of silvicultural prescription for single stands to landscape and large regional assessments. Key issues addressed with FVS include forest development, wildlife habitat, pest outbreaks, and fuels management. The predictions are used to gain insights into how forested environments will respond to alternative management actions. Broad-scale forest management policies have been studied with FVS. For the 30 years since the model was initially introduced, the development team has anticipated and provided needed enhancements and maintained a commitment to working with and training users. The existence of an adequate user interface and the continued use of the original programming language are often overlooked factors for the success of this model. Future work will focus on improving FVS by adopting recent biometric techniques and including new information linking geomorphology to mortality and growth. Extending the model to more closely represent biophysical processes and adapting the model so that it is more relevant to management questions related to predicted climate change are also foci. Providing ways to dynamically link FVS to other models is our current strategy for providing major new capabilities.},

	abstract = {Mixed species forests are presently on the advance and widely held to provide many ecosystem functions and services better than pure stands. Recent studies well explored species mixing effects at the individual tree or stand level. However, the link between individual and stand level which is represented by the size-structure dynamics of stands, is still hardly understood.Aim of this study: The objective was to analyse how species mixing modifies the size-structure dynamics of mixed compared with pure forest stands. Area of the study: the study was carried out in Southern Germany.Material and Methods: We selected 11long-term experiments comprising 129 plots of un-thinned or just lightly thinned pure and mixed stands of European beech (Fagus sylvatica [ L.]) and analysed their size structure dynamics.Main Results: Based on the Gini coefficient, skewness and kurtosis we show how mixing with Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst) and sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.) modifies the size-structure dynamics of European beech. The size distribution of beech in mixture mostly lags behind the pure stand, is more size-asymmetric, and the mortality shifts from the smaller diameter classes further to the taller trees than in pure stands.Research highlights: The revealed changes of the size-structure dynamics of beech in mixed versus pure stands result from a modification of both growth partitioning and self-thinning. We draw conclusions of the reduced size growth and size equality of beech in mixed versus pure stands for forest management planning and perspectives for forest research.Keywords: species selection effect; true mixing effect; morphological plasticity; size-distribution; growth partitioning between trees; mode of mortality; European beech (Fagus sylvatica [L.]); Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst); sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.)

	abstract = {Eucalyptus plantations have been established in many areas of the world due to their fast growth and profitability. In NW Spain, Eucalyptus plantations now cover a larger area than native forests. Although Eucalyptus plantations have been shown to affect biodiversity, relatively few studies have compared their effect on multiple taxonomic groups and different aspects of biodiversity. We compared herb and bird species richness and bird abundance between 14 paired patches of native deciduous forest and Eucalyptus plantations in a heterogeneous agro-forest region of NW Spain. We also investigated whether Eucalyptus plantations contribute to shifts in community composition by analysing species nestedness and turnover. We found that species richness of both herbs and birds was consistently lower in Eucalyptus plantations compared to native forests. Furthermore, the abundances of bird species characteristic of agricultural, forest, scrubland and other habitats, were all much lower in Eucalyptus plantations than in native forests. Herb and bird communities were also significantly dissimilar between the two habitats, but as a result of different ecological processes. Species turnover explained variation between habitats in herb composition, such that species present in native forests were typical for both farmland and forest habitats, whereas those present in Eucalyptus plantations were typical for scrub and farmland habitats. In contrast, bird assemblages showed a significant nested subset pattern, with fewer species in Eucalyptus plantations compared to native forests. In total, the relative abundance of cavity-nesting forest birds was at least 64\% higher in native forests. Our results show that Eucalyptus plantations cannot replace native forests as they harbour different herb species and only a subset of the bird species found in native forests. Considering the current rate of increase of Eucalyptus plantations and the fragmentation of native forests in NW Spain, a lack of conservation of native forests could result in future loss of biodiversity in general and forest specialist species in particular.},

However,they have been traditionally depicted as low profitable, tree-less, barrenlandsand have been either overlooked in conservation policies or included inextensive pine-tree afforestation programmes. Nowadays, most of the existingpine plantations are no longer exploited and have become dense pine woodlands.Here we present the results of a comparative analysis aimed to ascertain theeffects of pine stands on the structure and diversity of the woody component ofthese mediterranean heathlands. Ten sampling sites were located within thestudyarea, each consisting of two adjacent subsamples: an open heathland and aneighbouring heathland under pine-tree cover. Woody species richness andoverallshrub cover was much lower in pine-tree heath understoreys. This drop in coverwas more marked for short-lived species (seeders and withering resprouters),implying a decrease of the life-history diversity and also having noticeableconsequences in homogenizing the floristic composition of heath patches underpine trees. Heathland narrow endemics dropped significantly in pine stands,showing greater sensitivity to afforestation than nonendemics. We suggest thatthe open heathlands of the Strait of Gibraltar should be given furtherattentionin EU and IUCN conservation policies. Programmes should be implemented toprogressively eliminate abandoned pine plantations so as to restore andpreservethese highly diverse mediterranean heathlands.},

However, the consequences of these changes for terrestrial vegetation growth remain poorly quantified and understood. By examining a satellite-based vegetation index, tree-ring measurements and land-surface model simulations, we discovered a consistent convex pattern in the responses of vegetation growth to temperature exposure (TE) for forest, shrub and grass in both the temperate (30°−50° N) and boreal (50°−70° N) NH during the period of 1982−2012. The response of vegetation growth to TE for the three vegetation types in both the temperate and boreal NH increased convergently with increasing temperature, until vegetation type-dependent temperature thresholds were reached. A TE beyond these temperature thresholds resulted in disproportionately weak positive or even strong negative responses. Vegetation growth in the boreal NH was more vulnerable to extremely high-temperature events than vegetation growth in the temporal NH. The non-linear responses discovered here provide new insights into the dynamics of northern terrestrial ecosystems in a warmer world.},

	abstract = {The increasing disturbances in monocultures around the world are testimony to their instability under global change. Many studies have claimed that temporal stability of productivity increases with species richness, although the ecological fundamentals have mainly been investigated through diversity experiments. To adequately manage forest ecosystems, it is necessary to have a comprehensive understanding of the effect of mixing species on the temporal stability of productivity and the way in which it is influenced by climate conditions across large geographical areas. Here, we used a unique dataset of 261 stands combining pure and two-species mixtures of four relevant tree species over a wide range of climate conditions in Europe to examine the effect of species mixing on the level and temporal stability of productivity. Structural equation modelling was employed to further explore the direct and indirect influence of climate, overyielding, species asynchrony and additive effect (i.e. temporal stability expected from the species growth in monospecific stands) on temporal stability in mixed forests. We showed that by adding only one tree species to monocultures, the level (overyielding: +6\%) and stability (temporal stability: +12\%) of stand growth increased significantly. We identified the key effect of temperature on destabilizing stand growth, which may be mitigated by mixing species. We further confirmed asynchrony as the main driver of temporal stability in mixed stands, through both the additive effect and species interactions, which modify between-species asynchrony in mixtures in comparison to monocultures. Synthesis and applications. This study highlights the emergent properties associated with mixing two species, which result in resource efficient and temporally stable production systems. We reveal the negative impact of mean temperature on temporal stability of forest productivity and how the stabilizing effect of mixing two species can counterbalance this impact. The overyielding and temporal stability of growth addressed in this paper are essential for ecosystem services closely linked with the level and rhythm of forest growth. Our results underline that mixing two species can be a realistic and effective nature-based climate solution, which could contribute towards meeting EU climate target policies.},

	abstract = {Spruce-fir-beech mixed forests cover a large area in European mountain regions, with high ecological and socio-economic importance. As elevation-zone systems they are highly affected by climate change, which is modifying species growth patterns and productivity shifts among species. The extent to which associated tree species can access resources and grow asynchronously may affect their resistance and persistence under climate change. Intra-specific synchrony in annual tree growth is a good indicator of species specific dependence on environmental conditions variability. However, little attention has been paid to explore the role of the inter-specific growth asynchrony in the adaptation of mixed forests to climate change. Here we used a database of 1790 tree-ring series collected from 28 experimental plots in spruce-fir-beech mixed forests across Europe to explore how spatio-temporal patterns of the intra- and inter-specific growth synchrony relate to climate variation during the past century. We further examined whether synchrony in growth response to inter-annual environmental fluctuations depended on site conditions. We found that the inter-specific growth synchrony was always lower than the intra-specific synchrony, for both high (inter-annual fluctuations) and low frequency (mid- to long-term) growth variation, suggesting between species niche complementarity at both temporal levels. Intra- and inter-specific synchronies in inter-annual growth fluctuations significantly changed along elevation, being greater at higher elevations. Moreover, the climate warming likely induced temporal changes in synchrony, but the effect varied along the elevation gradient. The synchrony strongly intensified at lower elevations likely due to climate warming and drying conditions. Our results suggest that intra- and inter-specific growth synchrony can be used as an indicator of temporal niche complementarity among species. We conclude that spruce-fir-beech mixtures should be preferred against mono-specific forests to buffer climate change impacts in mountain regions.},

	abstract = {Seedling size-related functional attributes of Mediterranean forest species are critical traits to be considered in nursery practices aimed at improving the survival and performance of seedlings exposed to summer drought in dryland reforestation projects. We looked at how nursery light regimes and nitrogen fertilization affected the survival and performance of Pinus pinaster Ait. under contrasting post-planting watering regimes. Seedlings grown in the nursery for 13 months were given low or high nitrogen doses and exposed to three light regimes (full sun, medium light and low light). After outplanting, half of the seedlings were watered fortnightly during the hottest months of the first summer and the other half were left unwatered. Seedling size-related variables (shoot height, basal diameter, stem volume and sturdiness quotient) were measured at the beginning and at the end of the study, and summer drought survival was checked three times. Our results showed that fertilization and the nursery light regime influenced initial seedling quality and transplant stress. Post-planting first summer watering also increased seedling survival probability. The medium-light and especially the full-sunlight regimes in the nursery decreased the probability of seedling mortality after outplanting. However, a low-light regime in the nursery negatively affected plant traits and increased the probability of post-planting seedling mortality. In comparison with low-N seedlings, high-N fertilization increased post-planting stress (evaluated in the change of sturdiness quotient after one field growth season), but did not affect survival.},

In the present paper, simulated mean climate, internal climate variability, and climate sensitivity in MIROC6 are evaluated and briefly summarized in comparison with the previous version of our climate model (MIROC5) and observations. The results show that the overall reproducibility of mean climate and internal climate variability in MIROC6 is better than that in MIROC5. The tropical climate systems (e.g., summertime precipitation in the western Pacific and the eastward-propagating Madden–Julian oscillation) and the midlatitude atmospheric circulation (e.g., the westerlies, the polar night jet, and troposphere–stratosphere interactions) are significantly improved in MIROC6. These improvements can be attributed to the newly implemented parameterization for shallow convective processes and to the inclusion of the stratosphere. While there are significant differences in climates and variabilities between the two models, the effective climate sensitivity of 2.6\&thinsp;K remains the same because the differences in radiative forcing and climate feedback tend to offset each other. With an aim towards contributing to the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, designated simulations tackling a wide range of climate science issues, as well as seasonal to decadal climate predictions and future climate projections, are currently ongoing using MIROC6.},

While forest management of monocultures is well described, multispecies forests still need a better understanding to develop appropriate forest practice. Managing mixed forests can be more complex than managing monocultures because of the need to optimize the provision of multiple benefits according to the societal demands including sustaining biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. In this chapter we are going to present (1) the most important and well-described tree species combinations found in each participating countries taking biogeographical region in Europe into account, (2) the main management objectives of those mixtures, (3) the silvicultural approaches that are available for the particular mixed-species forests and (4) the main challenges experienced in mixed-species forest management. We synthesized information about management of mixed-species forests based on questionnaires received from both European countries and few countries from outside Europe participating in COST Action ‘EuMIXFOR’. The survey revealed that (i) the main management objective in the analysed mixtures is valuable timber production followed by protection of soil and water and protection of forests against disturbances, (ii) the uniform shelterwood is the most widespread regeneration method followed by the clear-cutting and the irregular shelterwood system, (iii) the crown thinning followed by low thinning is the most frequent thinning method, and (iv) the main challenge of management is high game pressure and the lack of management rules covering mixture growth and taking into account both species functional traits and site conditions.},

	abstract = {Forest dynamics are undergoing profound alteration due to the fact that climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of abiotic and biotic forest disturbances. Because of the unpredictable nature of the drought periods and the variation in their severity, Mediterranean forests are typically more vulnerable. Mediterranean Pinus pinaster forests are showing decay symptoms linked to climate change. There is clear evidence that promoting mixtures can serve as an effective forest adaptation strategy. In this regard, we sought to better understand the responses of P. pinaster radial growth dynamics to various factors, in both mixed and pure forest stands, and provide valuable insights into P. pinaster dynamics when mixed with P. sylvestris. In this study, we examined the variation of intra-annual cumulative radial increment patterns in response to the climate of P. pinaster between pure and mixed stands with P. sylvestris. Using data from band dendrometers collected over five consecutive climatically distinct years (2016–2020), a nonlinear mixed-effect model approach was used to analyze the differences in intra-annual cumulative radial increment patterns for P. pinaster between years in mixed and pure stands. The intra-annual radial increment pattern of P. pinaster showed significant year-to-year variation and varied with tree size, with greater increment in larger trees. Trees in mixed stands had a higher mean radial increment compared to corresponding ones in pure stands. Increased summer maximum temperatures negatively affected tree cumulative annual increment regardless of composition, but with a lower impact on trees in pure stands. Spring precipitation increased the length of the growing season, while higher spring maximum temperatures triggered an earlier inflection point. Our results highlight the high plasticity of P. pinaster in adapting to varying intra- and inter-annual environmental conditions and competition with other species and suggest that promoting mixtures with P. sylvestris may be an interesting management strategy for adaptation to climate change.},

	abstract = {The pattern that a given tree species suffers less damage when growing with heterospecific neighbors than amongst conspecific plants, i.e. associational resistance, is common for insect herbivores and many fungal pathogens. However, associational resistance to parasitic plants has never been tested in a replicated study. Using paired forest plots, we investigated whether tree diversity triggered associational resistance to a tree parasite, the European mistletoe Viscum album ssp. austriacum, by comparing pure stands of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) with mixtures of Scots pine and Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) in northern Spain. Maritime pine, with 1.2\% of trees being infested, was considered a non-host species in the study area. The infestation level of Scots pines was significantly higher in pure plots (45.1\%) than in mixed plots of Scots pines and Maritime pines (25.4\%). Our study is the first to quantify associational resistance to a plant parasite in mixed vs. pure forest stands and suggests that mechanisms proposed to explain associational resistance to insects and pathogens also apply to plant parasites. Scots pine trees that were taller than the surrounding trees had a higher infestation probability, in both pure and mixed stands. Scots pine trees growing in mixtures were slightly lower than Maritime pines, suggesting that associational resistance was partly driven by reduced relative tree height. However, the effect of plot type (pure vs. mixed) remained significant after the effect of tree height was accounted for, thus indicating that other factors also contributed to lower mistletoe infestation in mixed plots. In particular, the behavior of birds dispersing mistletoe seeds might differ in mixed vs. pure stands.},

	abstract = {Most mistletoes are xylem-tapping hemiparasites, which derive their resources from the host’s xylem solution. Thus, they affect the host’s water relations and resource balance. To understand the physiological mechanisms underlying the mistletoe–host relationship, we experimentally removed Viscum album ssp. austriacum (Wiesb.) Vollmann from adult Pinus sylvestris L. host trees growing in a Swiss dry valley. We analyzed the effects of mistletoe removal over time on host tree growth and on concentrations of nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC) and nitrogen (N) in needles, fine roots and sapwood. In addition, we assessed the δ13C and δ18O in host tree rings. After mistletoe removal, δ13C did not change in newly produced tree rings compared with tree rings in control trees (still infected with mistletoe), but δ18O values increased. This pattern might be interpreted as a decrease in assimilation (A) and stomatal conductance (gs), but in our study, it most likely points to an inadequacy of the dual isotope approach. Instead, we interpret the unchanged δ13C in tree rings upon mistletoe removal as a balanced increase in A and gs that resulted in a constant intrinsic water use efficiency (defined as A/gs). Needle area-based concentrations of N, soluble sugars and NSC, as well as needle length, single needle area, tree ring width and shoot growth, were significantly higher in trees from which mistletoe was removed than in control trees. This finding suggests that mistletoe removal results in increased N availability and carbon gain, which in turn leads to increased growth rates of the hosts. Hence, in areas where mistletoe is common and the population is large, mistletoe management (e.g., removal) may be needed to improve the host vigor, growth rate and productivity, especially for relatively small trees and crop trees in xeric growth conditions.},

Infected sample trees were classified as light, moderate or severe infection levels. Growth trends and basal area increment loses were compared between uninfected and infected trees for the periods of the last 10, 20 and 30 years. In addition, infection status of forest stands was investigated using temporary sample plots; 27 plots in Crimean pine stands and 26 plots in Scots pine. Results demonstrated that basal area increments were negatively affected by pine mistletoe for both species. Mean basal area increment losses of infected trees for the last decade were determined as 24\% for Scots pine and 26\% for Crimean pine. Basal area increment losses varied by infection levels (light, moderate and severe) as follows: 25\%, 20\% and 28\% for Scots pines and 20\%, 32\% and 9\% for Crimean pines. Scots pine stands were more severely infected by pine mistletoe than Crimean pine stands. There were negative correlations between number of infected trees and stand density for both species, while positive correlation was detected between the number of infected trees and mean diameter for Scots pine. The results of this study indicate that the pine mistletoe infection has negative effect on radial growth of Scots pine and Crimean pine trees.

	abstract = {This study sought to contribute to the understanding of the detrimental effect of the mistletoe (Viscum album L.), a hemiparasitic plant, on the mortality of the Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). Fieldwork was conducted in the town of Kelkit (Gumushane province, Turkey) from April to October in 2013. Pine needles of similar ages were removed from the branches of mistletoe-infested and noninfested Scots pine plants, then transported to the laboratory and used as research materials. The effects of the mistletoe on the Scots pine during infestation were evaluated by determining the levels of water, electrolyte leakage (EL), malondialdehyde (MDA, being a product of lipid peroxidation) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide anion (O2−•), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radical (•OH). In addition, the activities of antioxidative enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POX) were measured in the same samples. The highest level of drought stress was found in summer (especially in August) as a result of the lowest water content in the soil and the highest average temperature occurring in these months. The drought stress induced by mistletoe infestation caused a regular decrease in water content, while it increased the levels of EL, MDA and ROS (H2O2, O2−• and •OH). The infestation also stimulated the activities of CAT and POX, with the exception of SOD. On the other hand, in August, when the drought conditions were the harshest, the levels of EL and MDA, which are two of the most important indicator parameters for oxidative stress, as well as the levels of H2O2 and •OH, which are two of the ROS leading to oxidative stress, reached the highest values in both infested and noninfested needles, whereas the O2−• level decreased. For the same period and needles, CAT activity increased, while SOD activity decreased. Peroxidase activity, however, did not exhibit a significant change. Our findings indicate that the increased mortality of the Scots pine may result from the mistletoe-induced very severe drought stress, and that the increase in the capacity of antioxidative enzyme system does not protect the plant against oxidative stress in dry summer seasons.},

However, few data exist on how mistletoes are spatially arranged within trees and how this spatial pattern is related to changes in radial growth, responses to drought stress and carbon use. We used dendrochronology to quantify how mistletoe (Viscum album L.) infestation and drought stress affected long-term growth patterns in Pinus sylvestris L. at different heights. Basal area increment (BAI) trends and comparisons between trees of three different infestation degrees (without mistletoe, ID1; moderately infested trees, ID2; and severely infested trees, ID3) were performed using linear mixed-effects models. To identify the main climatic drivers of tree growth tree-ring widths were converted into indexed chronologies and related to climate data using correlation functions. We performed spatial analyses of the 3D distribution of mistletoe individuals and their ages within the crowns of three severely infested pines to describe their patterns. Lastly, we quantified carbohydrate and nitrogen concentrations in needles and sapwood of branches from severely infested trees and from trees without mistletoe. Mistletoe individuals formed strongly clustered groups of similar age within tree crowns and their age increased towards the crown apex. Mistletoe infestation negatively impacted growth but this effect was stronger near the tree apex than in the rest of sampled heights, causing an average loss of 64\% in BAI (loss of BAI was ∼51\% at 1.3 m or near the tree base). We found that BAI of severely infested trees and moderately or non-infested trees diverged since 2001 and such divergence was magnified by drought. Infested trees had lower concentrations of soluble sugars in their needles than non-infested ones. We conclude that mistletoe infestation causes growth decline and increases the sensitivity of trees to drought stress.},

	abstract = {Intraspecific variation in plant defences is expected to be the result of adaptive and plastic responses to environmental conditions, where trade-offs between growth and defences are thought to play a key role shaping phenotypic patterns in defensive investment. Axial resin ducts are costly defensive structures that remain imprinted in the tree rings of conifers, therefore being a valuable proxy of defensive investment along the trees’ lifespan. We aimed to disentangle climate-driven adaptive clines and plastic responses to both spatial and temporal environmental variation in resin duct production, and to explore growth-defence trade-offs. To that aim, we applied dendrochronological procedures to quantify annual growth and resin duct production during a 31-year-period in a Mediterranean pine species, including trees from nine populations planted in two common gardens. Both genetic factors and plastic responses modulated annual resin duct production. However, we found no evidence of adaptive clines with climate gradients driving population differentiation. Our results revealed a marked physiological trade-off between growth and defences, where the slope of the trade-off was genetically variable and associated with climatic gradients. Our results help to enlighten the evolutionary patterns and genetic basis of defensive allocation within species, particularly revealing a key role of growth-defence trade-offs.},

	abstract = {Studying species coexistence is key to understanding the way in which forests will respond to climate change. We studied the patterns of mixed stands including two main Mediterranean pine species: Pinus pinaster Ait. and Pinus pinea L. The spatial distribution of adult trees and saplings was studied via a point pattern approach. The effect of competition on growth of adult trees was investigated by comparing the performance of several competition indexes for each pine species through generalized linear models. Adult trees formed mixed clumps in which individuals of both species appeared together. Part of the tree growth variation was explained by tree size along with tree competition. However, the effect of conspecific vs heterospecific competition on tree growth differed and reflected species-specific neighbor-asymmetric competition. Facilitation was fundamental in the early stages for tree species development. The spatial distribution of saplings was strongly related to the spatial distribution of adult trees, also being asymmetrically clustered and neighbor-species-dependent. However, the required facilitation in early life-stage trees shifted to competition among trees in the adult stage. Species mixture may be desirable in terms of increasing and diversifying productivity, although the conditions currently present in the stand are likely to lead to future dominance of P. pinea over P. pinaster due not only to the greater competition tolerance of the former but also to a greater ability to successfully recruit in the plots, forming clusters that may be in turn be impenetrable to P. pinaster. Therefore, in order to maintain mixed stands, it would be necessary to enforce adequate silvicultural management strategies which avoid future stand dominance by P. pinea.},

Here, we developed generalized height–diameter (h-d) and basal area growth models for mixed stands of two main forest species in Spain: Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.). Mixed-effects models were fitted from plot measurement and tree rings data from 726 Scots pine and 693 Maritime pine trees from mixed and pure stands in the Northern Iberian Range in Spain, with the primary objective of representing interactions between the species where they are interspersed in mixtures of varying proportions. An independent dataset was used to test the performance of the h-d models against models previously fitted for monospecific stands of both species. Basal area increment models were evaluated using a 10-fold block cross-validation procedure. We found that species mixing had contrasting effects on the species in both models. In h-d models, the species-mixing proportion determined the effect of species interactions. Basal area growth models showed that interspecific competition was influential only for Maritime pine; however, these effects differed depending on the mode of competition. For Scots pine, tree growth was not restricted by interspecies competition. The combination of mixed-effect models and the inclusion of parameters expressing species-mixing enhanced estimates of tree height and basal area growth compared with the available models previously developed for pure stands. Although the species-mixing effects were successfully represented in the fitted models, additional model components for accurately simulating the stand dynamics of mixtures with Scots pine and Maritime pine and other species mixtures require similar model refinements. Upon the completion of analyses required for these model refinements, the degree of improvement in simulating growth in species mixtures, including the effects of different management options, can be evaluated.},

We conclude that forest management is an effective way to maintain and enhance high carbon sequestration rates in order to cope with climate change and provision of ecosystem services. We also think that although much effort has been put into this topic research, there are still certain gaps that must be dealt with to increase our scientific knowledge and in turn transfer this knowledge to forest practitioners in order to achieve sustainable management aimed at mitigating climate change.Research highlights: It is important to underline the importance of forests in the carbon cycle as this role can be enhanced by forest managers through sustainable forest management. The effects of different management options or disturbances can be critical as regards mitigating climate change. Understanding the effects of forest management is even more important in the Mediterranean area, given that the current high climatic variability together with historical human exploitation and disturbance events make this area more vulnerable to the effects of climate change},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to predict the effect of forest management intensity on mushroom productivity at the landscape level by means of a model-based scenario analysis. The study area was Catalonia region, north-eastern Iberian Peninsula. Mushroom yield models were developed for the most common pine-dominated forest ecosystems. The models accounted for the effect of site and stand structure on mushroom occurrence and yield. The mushroom yield models and individual-tree growth models were used in continuous cover forestry simulation and optimization to assess the impact of alternative regional forest management intensity scenarios on landscape-level mushroom productivity. The baseline scenario was defined as the estimated current forest harvesting intensity in Catalonia (i.e., 25\% of annual forest growth). The time frame was 30yr. The current average productivity of valuable mushrooms is 14kgha−1yr−1 (4600tonnesyr−1). Under the current forest management intensity, a loss of 220tonnesyr−1 (5\%) in mushroom production at the regional level can be expected. In the absence of forest management, the loss in productivity can attain almost 500tonnesyr−1 (11\%). With forest harvesting intensity similar to the average in Europe, an increase of 100tonnesyr−1 (2\%) in mushroom production could be expected. If forest harvesting was equal to 100\% of annual forest growth, an increase of 262tonnesyr−1 (6\%) could be expected. Mushroom productivity increases with increasing forest management intensity. Low forest management intensities may result in a progressive reduction in mushroom yield. Intermediate management intensities would maintain the current mushroom productivity. Sustained yield harvesting policy would contribute to increasing mushroom productivity in continuous cover forestry.},

We assessed the future provision of ecosystem services by Mediterranean pine forests under a set of management and climate change scenarios, built by combining different regional policies and climate change assumptions. We used the process-based model SORTIE-ND to simulate forest dynamics under each scenario. We coupled the outputs of SORTIE-ND with empirical and process-based models to estimate changes in harvested timber, carbon storage, mushroom yield, water provision, soil erosion mitigation and habitat for biodiversity by 2100, and assessed the trade-offs and synergies between services. Our results suggest that future provision of ecosystem services by Mediterranean forests will be more strongly determined by management policies than by climate. However, no management policy maximized the provision of all services. The continuation of the business-as-usual management would benefit some services to the detriment of water provision, but leads to higher vulnerability to extreme drought-events or wildfires. Managing for reducing forest vulnerability will balance the provision of services while reducing the risk of damage to forest functioning. We also found multiple spatial synergies between ecosystem services provision, likely driven by differences in site productivity.},

	abstract = {Recent decades have seen an increase in research interest in mixed forests and greater policy support for measures designed to develop mixed-species stands. However, reports from a range of European countries show many practical difficulties which are hampering the successful implementation of mixed forest management. This is reflected in a widespread lack of guidance to help managers tackle the complicated silviculture of mixed forests. We present case studies from four different countries in Europe which illustrate different aspects of the management of mixed forests. These showed that successful introduction of a range of species depended upon a favourable light climate for the young seedlings and adequate control of browsing animals. The establishment of a mixed stand might take several decades and could require careful tending during the early years. Forest development types (FDTs) have been used in a few countries as a means of defining future stand development goals, and this concept provides a structured mechanism for developing silvicultural guidance for mixed stands. FDTs can be linked to information about the impacts of projected climate change to provide a framework for implementing a site-specific and adaptive silviculture that promotes mixed forests to deliver a range of benefits over time.},

Much recent work has indicated that the structure and growth of mixed species forests may fundamentally differ from monocultures. Here we suggest how to progress from the present accumulation of phenomenological findings to a design of mixed-species stands and advanced silvicultural prescriptions by means of modelling. First, the knowledge of mixing effects on the structure and growth at the stand, species, and individual tree level is reviewed, with a focus on those findings that are most essential for suitable modelling and silvicultural designs and the regulation of mixed stands as opposed to monocultures. Then, the key role of growth models, stand simulators, and scenario assessments for designing mixed species stands is discussed. The next section illustrates that existing forest stand growth models require some fundamental modifications to become suitable for both monocultures and mixed-species stands. We then explore how silvicultural prescriptions derived from scenario runs would need to be both quantified and simplified for transfer to forest management and demonstrated in training plots. Finally, we address the main remaining knowledge gaps that could be remedied through empirical research.},

	abstract = {Silvicultural approaches for mixed-species stands typically aim at creating and maintaining stand compositional and structural diversity to provide the desired ecosystem function. An important aim of regeneration and tending is to develop stable mixtures that facilitate the anticipated interactions among the participating tree species and at the same time require little silvicultural input to maintain the composition of compatible tree species. To ensure survival and vigorous growth of trees in mixture in the long term, it is often necessary to separate species in space and time during the regeneration phase. Weaker competitors can be given a head start through advance regeneration or may be regenerated in patches that protect the majority of individuals from interspecific competition. In managed forests, tree species in mixture may also have a service function. For example, nurse crops may be used to facilitate establishment of sensitive tree species and to accelerate ecosystem recovery following disturbances. Trainer species are typically used to improve the quality development of stems of economically important species. Whereas the regeneration of mixtures has received considerable attention in research, there is little specific information regarding the thinning of mixed-species stands, which are often treated like an agglomerate of monospecific stands of the companion species. In the absence of quantitative information on optimal tree spacing, stand density, or the growth response to thinning in mixtures, crop tree thinning approaches are recommended. These facilitate the maintenance of desired species proportions as well as stand stability and development of quality attributes in crop trees through simple indicators. Although it is often assumed that the development of stem quality in mixtures is inferior to that in monospecific stands, there is so far little solid evidence to support this assumption. Rather, it appears that stem quality depends on specific interactions between species and the structural heterogeneity of stands.},

However, they are essential for the well-conceived establishment, design, and control of mixed-species stands, currently promoted in many countries worldwide. Here, we review the state of the art and we further develop silvicultural prescriptions for mixed-species stands for steering of experiments, stand modeling, and silviculture. We review which aspects of tree species mixing are most relevant for management goal achievement. We found the maintenance of species diversity and structural heterogeneity for ecological purpose, stabilizing productivity, and social-economic performance as main objectives. We give an overview of quantitatively formulated silvicultural prescriptions for steering mixed-species stands for forest practice, long-term experiments, forest stand models. Compared with the sophisticated guidelines for mono-specific stands, prescriptions for mixed stand are often mainly qualitative and vague. Then, we introduce methodological approaches in development for steering mixture: measures for spatial and temporal separation, species-specific growing space requirements for crop trees, coefficients for equivalence and density modification, and basic relationships for steering tree number and area-based mixing proportions. Finally, we draw conclusions for further development of methodological approaches for silvicultural steering of experiments, implementation in stand simulators, and for silvicultural operations. We see the need for improving the quantitative spatially explicit rules based at tree or cohort level, for substantiating the knowledge on species-specific allometry, growing area, tree-to-tree distances, and position-dependent competition indices for steering tree removal. We discuss the prospects and limitations of establishing silvicultural prescriptions for mixed-species stands that inevitably will be more complicated than those for mono-specific stands, and we draw conclusions for next steps in science and practice.},

Although thinning provides off-site C storage (in the form of wood products) it is still not clear whether it results in an increase, a reduction or no change in on-site C storage. In this study we analyze the effect of thinning on C stocks in a long-term experiment. Different thinning intensities (moderate, heavy and unthinned) have been applied over the last 30 years in a Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand, with a thinning rotation period of 10 years. The main C compartments were analyzed: above and belowground tree biomass, deadwood, forest floor and upper 30-cm of the mineral soil and tree biomass removed in thinning treatments. The results revealed that unthinned stands had the highest C stocks with 315 Mg C ha−1, moderate thinning presented 304 Mg C ha−1 and heavy thinning 296 Mg C ha−1, with significant differences between unthinned and heavily thinned stands. These differences were mainly due to C stock in live biomass, which decreased with thinning intensity. However, soil C stocks, forest floor and mineral soil, were not influenced by thinning, all of the stands displaying very similar values 102–107 Mg C ha−1 for total soil; 15–19 Mg C ha−1 for forest floor; 87–88 Mg C ha−1 for mineral soil). These results highlight the sustainability of thinning treatments in terms of C stocks in this pinewood afforestation, and provide valuable information for forest management aimed at mitigating climate change.},

Despite their economic and ecological importance, models that describe the influence of different factors on mushroom yield are few. These models would support multi-objective forest management and planning that takes into account mushroom production. This study aims at providing models for predicting the total yield of wild ectomycorrhizal mushrooms and, especially, of L. group deliciosus and B. edulis. Mushroom data were collected in 18 permanent plots in pure even-aged Pinus sylvestris stands during fifteen consecutive years. Variables describing weather conditions, stand structure and local site characteristics were used as predictors in the modeling process. Rainfall and temperature were significant predictors in all the fitted models. In addition, the total yield of ectomycorrhizal fungi was significantly affected by dominant height and stand age. The production of L. group deliciosus was influenced by dominant height and stand basal area. The equation fitted for B. edulis, to our knowledge, is the first model for this species. It shows that stand basal area is a strong factor influencing the yield. The equations presented in this study enable predictions of mushroom yield under different forest management schedules and climatic scenarios.},

Two-stage mixed-effects models were used to examine the effect of predictors on mushroom occurrence and yield separately with the aim of providing further insight into the ecological system. Changes in seasonal precipitation represented the main weather-related driver affecting sporocarp emergence and production, since they were both positively influenced by late summer and early autumn precipitation.

	abstract = {Long-term field-data series were used to fit a mushroom productivity model. Simulations enabled us to predict the consequences of management and climate scenarios on potential mushroom productivity. Mushrooms play an important ecological and economic role in forest ecosystems. Human interest in collecting mushrooms for self-consumption is also increasing, giving forests added value for providing recreational services. Pinus pinaster Ait. is a western Mediterranean species of great economic and ecological value. Over 7.5\% of the total European distribution of the species is found on the Castilian Plateau in central Spain, where a great variety of mushrooms can be harvested. The aim of this study was to model and simulate mushroom productivity in Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) ecosystems in northern Spain under different silvicultural and climatic scenarios. A mixed model was fitted that related total mushroom productivity to stand and weather variables. The model was uploaded to the SiManFor platform to study the effect of different silvicultural and climatic scenarios on mushroom productivity. The selected independent variables in the model were the ratio between stand basal area and density as a stand management indicator, along with precipitation and average temperatures for September and November. The simulation results also showed that silviculture had a positive impact on mushroom productivity, which was higher in scenarios with moderate and high thinning intensities. The impact was highly positive in wetter scenarios, though only slightly positive and negative responses were observed in hotter and drier scenarios, respectively. Silviculture had a positive impact on mushroom productivity, especially in wetter scenarios. Precipitation had greater influence than temperature on total mushroom productivity in Maritime pine stands. The results of this paper will enable forest managers to develop optimal management approaches for P. pinaster forests that integrate Non-Wood Forest Products resources.},

There is increasing evidence that biodiversity contributes to forest ecosystem functioning and the provision of ecosystem services. Here we provide a review of forest ecosystem services including biomass production, habitat provisioning services, pollination, seed dispersal, resistance to wind storms, fire regulation and mitigation, pest regulation of native and invading insects, carbon sequestration, and cultural ecosystem services, in relation to forest type, structure and diversity. We also consider relationships between forest biodiversity and multifunctionality, and trade-offs among ecosystem services. We compare the concepts of ecosystem processes, functions and services to clarify their definitions. Our review of published studies indicates a lack of empirical studies that establish quantitative and causal relationships between forest biodiversity and many important ecosystem services. The literature is highly skewed; studies on provisioning of nutrition and energy, and on cultural services, delivered by mixed-species forests are under-represented. Planted forests offer ample opportunity for optimising their composition and diversity because replanting after harvesting is a recurring process. Planting mixed-species forests should be given more consideration as they are likely to provide a wider range of ecosystem services within the forest and for adjacent land uses. This review also serves as the introduction to this special issue of Biodiversity and Conservation on various aspects of forest biodiversity and ecosystem services.},

However, it is unclear how such a general understanding can inform policies for the management of ecosystem services in production systems, because these systems are primarily used for food or fibre, and are rarely managed for the conservation of species diversity. Here, using data from a nationwide forest inventory covering an area of 230,000 km2, we show that relative abundances of commercial tree species in mixed stands strongly influence the potential to provide ecosystem services. The mixes provided higher levels of ecosystem services compared to respective plant monocultures (overyielding or transgressive overyielding) in 35\% of the investigated cases, and lower (underyielding) in 9\% of the cases. We further show that relative abundances, not just species richness per se, of specific tree-species mixtures affect the potential of forests to provide multiple ecosystem services, which is crucial information for policy and sustainable forest management.},

To guide management that seeks to promote multiple services, we investigated the relationships between 12 stand-level forest attributes, including structure, composition, heterogeneity and plant diversity, plus 4 environmental factors, and proxies for 14 ecosystem services in 150 temperate forest plots. Our results show that forest attributes are the best predictors of most ecosystem services and are also good predictors of several synergies and trade-offs between services. Environmental factors also play an important role, mostly in combination with forest attributes. Our study suggests that managing forests to increase structural heterogeneity, maintain large trees, and canopy gaps would promote the supply of multiple ecosystem services. These results highlight the potential for forest management to encourage multifunctional forests and suggest that a coordinated landscape-scale strategy could help to mitigate trade-offs in human-dominated landscapes.},

	abstract = {Uneven-aged mountain forests are considered favourable for the continuous provisioning of multiple ecosystem services (ES). These ES may however exhibit trade-offs or synergies that can be modulated by forest management. Yet, our knowledge remains poor on both the relationships between ES and the way management practices can optimise and reconcile them. In this study, we aimed at (1) characterising trade-offs and synergies between timber production, biodiversity conservation and protection against natural hazards; (2) identifying efficient (i.e. Pareto-optimal) management scenarios for the joint provisioning of these ES; and (3) comparing them to “reference” management scenarios. Using a simulation framework that couples a forest dynamics model, a silviculture algorithm and linker functions relating ES indicators to stand structure, we predicted the response of different ES indicators to various uneven-aged management practices in the Western Alps. With a metamodeling approach and Pareto front techniques, we intensively explored and analysed relationships between ES indicators and found trade-offs between timber production and other ES, but synergies between protection and biodiversity. “Pareto-optimal” management scenarios were characterised by low thinning and harvesting intensities but exhibited gradients of total removals and deadwood and large tree retention along the Pareto front. They greatly differed from our set of production and biodiversity oriented reference scenarios, thus emphasising the strong impact of considering additional ES in scenario optimisation processes. This study highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of Pareto front techniques for both the analysis of trade-offs and synergies between ES and the identification of efficient management practices.},

	abstract = {Mixed forests are crucial to climate resilience in Mediterranean ecosystems and show great potential for mitigating the effects of climate change. Proper parameterization and integration of mixed-forest models into simulation platforms open the possibility to explore and assess alternative silvicultural paths. In this study, a climate-sensitive growth model for mixed forests was implemented on SIMANFOR, offering parameterizations for 29 species mixtures including the most frequent in Spain. After describing the model implementation process and its potential applications, a case study is presented to show the mixed-model performance, thus using data from the Spanish Fourth National Forest Inventory (SNFI4) and previously developed silviculture scenarios for Castilla and Leon region (Spain). The case study analysed four different mixtures of Pinus sylvestris with Pinus nigra, Pinus pinaster, Fagus sylvatica, and Quercus pyrenaica, which were selected for their complementarity, productivity, and resource-use efficiency. The results show that thinned mixed stands exhibited higher quadratic mean diameter, biomass and carbon content compared to unthinned stands. The differences observed in biomass and carbon allocation among silvicultural scenarios were consistent in all mixtures. This case study shows how simulations can play a crucial role in understanding the potential of different silvicultural alternatives and in orientating forest management guidelines.},

It shows how interactions with various stakeholders are essential in order to choose the goal programming model applied, as well as some of its basic components (variant, targets, preferential weights, etc.). This methodology has been applied to a real forest management case where five criteria have been selected: timber production, wild edible mushroom production, carbon sequestration, net present value of the underlying investment, and a criterion associated with the sustainability of forest management defined by the idea of a normal forest. Given the characteristics of some of these criteria, such as mushroom production, the model has been developed in two scenarios: one deterministic and another with a Monte Carlo analysis. The results show a considerable degree of conflict between the proposed criteria. By applying several goal programming models, different    Paretian efficient solutions were obtained. In addition, some results in Monte Carlo analysis for several criteria show notable variations. This fact is especially notable for the mushroom production criterion. Finally, the proposed approach seems attractive and can be directly applied to other forest management situations.},

Stand structure—the size and spatial distributions of trees within the stand—strongly influences water, light, and nutrient availability, as well as the resource-use efficiency of each tree. Key silvicultural tools for stand management include manipulating tree density, size distribution, and arrangement by controlling natural regeneration, artificial seeding, planting seedlings, and/or subsequent thinning of established trees. We analyzed two sets of plots from even-aged stands of common coniferous species in central Spain, 106 pure Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and 92 pure Mediterranean pine (Pinus pinaster), to examine the dynamics of the dominance hypothesis, the relationship between stand structure and growth, and the relationship between structure and growth efficiency. Our main findings revealed a negative impact of size-class uniformity on stand growth in both Scots pine and Mediterranean pine, while the positive effect of tree size on growth efficiency was supported for Mediterranean pine stands but uncertain for Scots pine. At the operational level, our results highlight how thinning intensity is more important than the thinning method in Mediterranean pinewoods and how thinning can benefit the provision of multiple ecosystem services. We also recommend integrating dominance effects on growth into individual tree modelling.},

For this purpose, we studied radial increment in a Scots pine-Pyrenean oak (Pinus sylvestris L.-Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) Mediterranean mixed forest in north-west Spain over two climatically contrasting years (2016–2017). The data came from a thinning trial consisting of a randomized latin square design with a control and two commercial thinning treatments from below; one moderate and the other heavy, removing 25\% and 50 \% of initial basal area, respectively, of both species. The radial increment was analyzed based on bi-weekly readings from band dendrometers installed on 90 oak and pine trees. A non-linear mixed model based on double-Richards curve was fitted to explore the differences between thinning treatments and species response in the intra-annual cumulative radial increment patterns. Inter-annual basal area increments for each species at stand level were quantified by aggregating the tree estimates obtained from the model fitted in the first step. Tree and stand level growth were greater in Scots pine, which also showed a greater growth response to early spring droughts than the Pyrenean oak. Heavy thinning increased radial increment in trees of both species at the expense of decreased total stand basal area. At species level, basal area growth in Scots pine decreased through thinning, whereas for Pyrenean oak, the heavy thinning intensity resulted in the same basal area growth as the control. Thus, heavy thinning induced a trade-off between total stand growth and tree-level response to climatic conditions for Scots pine but with no loss in productivity in the case of the Pyrenean oak. Hence, heavy thinning may be an appropriate measure to attain productive stability of the oak coppice in the studied mixed forest as well as to adapt tree growth to future droughts associated with climate change.},

	abstract = {Pinus sylvestris is widely distributed in Europe and Asia, and Portugal constitutes its westernmost limit. The reduction of the Portuguese forest area of resinous species has provoked strong constraints on wood industries supply. Therefore, an increase in Scots pine area might be important, namely by reforestations of higher altitude areas, where Pinus pinaster has great difficulties to vegetate and where the risk of pinewood nematode attack is smaller. However, large gaps remain in the knowledge of Pinus sylvestris wood characteristics growing in Portugal. To address this question, the radial wood density and growth were evaluated by X-ray microdensitometric technique, sampling 100 adult trees from five representative sites of P. sylvestris distribution area in Portugal. The results revealed that Portuguese Pinus sylvestris shows good radial growth and denser wood than those found in northern European regions. Among the Portuguese stands, sites at a lower altitude (Gerês and Marão) exhibited denser wood. Regarding density components, it was verified that the differences among sites were more significant in latewood, while the differences between trees/sites were most expressive in earlywood. These facts induce a higher genetic control in earlywood characteristics and a greater dependence of latewood components on environmental and climatic effects. Regarding growth components, Trees and Rings effects were more noticeable than Site effect. Concerning radial patterns, Portuguese Pinus sylvestris shows a downward trend in the first years after the pith, followed by an increase in latter rings for the density traits, while the radial variation of ring width is expressed by a tendency of decrease from the pith to the cambium. Compared to other European regions, Portuguese Pinus sylvestris reveals good wood quality features, namely higher density and ring width values. However, compared to Portuguese Pinus pinaster it shows a relatively lower density and identical or relatively lower radial growth. Scots pine could be a good solution for future reforestations of Portuguese mountainous areas, less favorable to other species.},

	abstract = {Studying species interactions in mixed forests allows us to assess their potential benefits and adapt current silvicultural tools developed in monospecific stands to multi-specific stands. We analyzed tree interactions in a Pinus halepensis Mill. and Pinus pinea L. mixed plantation using individual tree neighborhood models and competition indices that accounted for symmetric and asymmetric competition, to analyze whether the growth of each species was better explained by symmetric or asymmetric competition. We also split the competition indices into their intra- and interspecific forms, to test for competition effects on growth change based on competitor identity. Finally, we analyzed whether P. halepensis and P. pinea trees had different growth responses to competition. When calculating competition indices, we explored how spatial information and size of competitor trees contributed to the quantification of the process. Competition measurements were optimized to more precisely describe interactions. Results showed that the inclusion of competition indices generated important improvements in growth models. The main mode of competition was symmetric, which could be related to water restrictions typical of the Mediterranean climate. Considering competitor identity did not improve the growth models, while measurement without discriminating competitors by species generated more parsimonious models. P. halepensis and P. pinea trees had similar growth responses to competition, indicating that the two species cope with competition in similar ways. However, P. pinea showed lower average growth than P. halepensis in the period analyzed. Results suggest that preventing the onset of intense interspecific competition processes could help slow down the long-term replacement of P. pinea by P. halepensis and could have benefits for silvicultural management in systems with two species that share ecological niches but are capable of generating different goods and services.},

We analyzed architectural relationships between stem and crown dimensions for 13 dominant Iberian canopy tree species belonging to the Pinaceae (six Pinus species) and Fagaceae (six Quercus species and Fagus sylvatica) and related these architectural traits to wood density, shade tolerance and climatic factors. Fagaceae had, compared with Pinaceae, denser wood, saplings with wider crowns and adults with larger maximal crown size but smaller maximal height. In combination, these traits enhance light acquisition and persistence in shaded environments; thus, contributing to their shade tolerance. Pinaceae species, in contrast, had low-density wood, allocate more resources to the formation of the central trunk rather than to branches and attained taller maximal heights, allowing them to grow rapidly in height and compete for light following disturbances; thus, contributing to their high light requirements. Wood density had a strong relationship with tree architecture, with dense-wooded species having smaller maximum height and wider crowns, probably because of cheaper expansion costs for producing biomechanically stable branches. Species from arid environments had shorter stems and shallower crowns for a given stem diameter, probably to reduce hydraulic path length and assure water transport. Wood density is an important correlate of variation in tree architecture between species and the two dominant families, with potentially large implications for their resource foraging strategies and successional dynamics.},

The lowest photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm in dark-adapted leaves) was reached in deep shade (1\% of full sunlight) in all species except Q. robur, which had the lowest photochemical efficiency in both deep shade and 100\% of full sunlight. Species differed significantly in their survival in 1\% of full sunlight but exhibited similar survivorship in 6, 20 and 100\% of full sunlight. Shade-tolerant oaks had lower leaf area ratios, shoot to root ratios, foliage allocation ratios and higher rates of allocation to structural biomass (stem plus thick roots) than shade-intolerant pines. Overall phenotypic plasticity for each species, estimated as the difference between the minimum and the maximum mean values of the ecophysiological variables studied at the various irradiances divided by the maximum mean value of those variables, was inversely correlated with shade tolerance. Observed morphology, allocation and plasticity conformed to a conservative resource-use strategy, although observed differences in specific leaf area, which was higher in shade-tolerant species, supported a carbon gain maximization strategy. Lack of a congruent suite of traits underlying shade tolerance in the studied species provides evidence of adaptation to multiple selective forces. Although the study was based on only four species, the importance of ecophysiological variables as determinants of interspecific differences in survival in limiting light was demonstrated.},

Each pine sapling was described by its height, diameter and age and by the light reaching its apex. Pine sapling height and diameter were positively correlated with light and age. The results highlighted that Scots pine, a tree species usually described as shade-intolerant, is able to grow, although slowly, in shaded conditions (less than 10 per cent of full sunlight). However, the results also showed that a more shaded growing environment leads to lower maximal pine sapling height whatever its age. Together with results from studies on other species, these results provide further evidence of a critical sapling size at a given light level beyond which the pine sapling is likely to die and suggest that this critical size increases with light availability.},

SDMDs which are based on empirical models at stand level, graphically represent the temporal relationships among stand density, and different stand variables such as quadratic mean diameter, dominant height, and mean tree volume. They are used to define initial planting spacing or thinning interventions, to meet various management objectives. Nowadays, there is a growing interest in mixed-species forests as an option for adaptive forest management, where they are considered a guarantor to safeguarding a wide variety of ecosystem services within the framework of sustainability. But there is still a lack of knowledge and efficient tools and models for mixed stands such as SDMDs. This study aims to develop an SDMD for Pinus sylvestris L. and Pinus pinaster Ait. mixed stands in the Sierra de la Demanda (Spain) using data from the third Spanish National Forest Inventory. Both species are two of the most important conifers in Europe and the western Mediterranean basin. Different variables can be used to develop an SDMD. In this case, quadratic mean diameter, dominant height, total stand volume, number of trees per hectare, and stand density index were used. These equations were fit by simultaneous fitting including a new variable representing the proportion of both species in the mixed stand. The results of the simultaneous fitting showed the new variable representing the proportion of both species was not significant. Based on that, the SDMD was constructed without including mixture degree. This SDMD can be used by forest managers as an efficient tool to plan thinning operations.},

Whole-stand yield, growth models and individual tree equations were used to estimate carbon stock in forests under different silvicultural alternatives and site indexes. Each alternative was evaluated on the basis of the land expectation value (LEV). Results reveal the appropriateness of implementing carbon payments, because it can clearly complement traditional management objectives in economic terms. Longer rotations on the poorest sites result in a positive economic return by introducing carbon output. The proportion of carbon stock in the final harvest relative to total fixed carbon is always higher in long rotation scenarios. However, short rotation systems produce the highest values of carbon MAI regardless of site index. The impact of carbon price is higher on the Maritime pine stands than on Scots pine stands. For both the species, changes in the discount rate have a minor impact on Carbon LEV. Notwithstanding, the proportion of total LEV due to carbon is greater when the discount rate increases.},

	abstract = {Proactive silviculture treatments (e.g., thinning) may increase C sequestration contributing to climate change mitigation, although, there are still questions about this effect in Mediterranean pine forests. The aim of this research was to quantify the storage of biomass and soil organic carbon in Pinus forests along a climatic gradient from North to South of the Iberian Peninsula. Nine experimental Pinus spp trials were selected along a latitudinal gradient from the pre-Pyrenees to southern Spain. At each location, a homogeneous area was used as the operational scale, and three thinning intensity treatments: unthinned or control (C), intermediate thinning (LT, removal of 30–40\% of the initial basal area) and heavy thinning (HT, removal of 50–60\%) were conducted. Growth per unit area (e.g., expressed as basal area increment-BAI), biomass, and Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) were measured as well as three sets of environmental variables (climate, soil water availability and soil chemical and physical characteristics). One-way ANOVA and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) were used to study the effect of thinning and environmental variables on C sequestration. Biomass and growth per unit area were higher in the control than in the thinning treatments, although differences were only significant for P. halepensis. Radial growth recovered after thinning in all species, but it was faster in the HT treatments. Soil organic carbon (SOC10, 0–10 cm depth) was higher in the HT treatments for P. halepensis and P. sylvestris, but not for P. nigra. SEM showed that Pinus stands of the studied species were beneficed by HT thinning, recovering their growth quickly. The resulting model explained 72\% of the variation in SOC10 content, and 89\% of the variation in silvicultural condition (basal area and density) after thinning. SOC10 was better related to climate than to silvicultural treatments. On the other hand, soil chemical and physical characteristics did not show significant influence over SOC10- Soil water availability was the latent variable with the highest influence over SOC10. This work is a new contribution that shows the need for forest managers to integrate silviculture and C sequestration in Mediterranean pine plantations.},

	abstract = {Use of reduced-impact logging (RIL) techniques has repeatedly been shown to reduce damage caused by logging. Unfortunately, these techniques do not necessarily ameliorate the low growth rates of many commercial species or otherwise assure recovery of the initial volume harvested during the next cutting cycle. In this study, we analyze the effect of logging and application of additional silvicultural treatments (liana cutting and girdling of competing trees) on the growth rates on trees in general and on of future crop trees (FCTs) of 24 commercial timber species. The study was carried out in a moist tropical forest in Bolivia, where we monitored twelve 27-ha plots for 4 years. Plots received one of four treatments in which logging intensity and silvicultural treatments were varied: control (no logging); normal (reduced-impact) logging; normal logging and low-intensity silviculture; and, increased logging intensity and high-intensity silviculture. Tree growth rates increased with intensity of logging and silvicultural treatments. The growth rates of FCTs of commercial species were 50–60\% higher in plots that received silvicultural treatments than in the normal logging and control plots. Responses to silvicultural treatments varied among functional groups. The largest increase in growth rates was observed in FCTs belonging to the partially shade-tolerant and the shade-tolerant groups. These results indicate that silvicultural treatments, in addition to the use of RIL techniques, are more likely to result in a higher percentage of timber volume being recovered after the first cutting cycle than RIL alone.},

In recent years, Pinus nigra forests in the Mediterranean basin have been dramatically affected by the new risk of highly intense and extreme fires and its distribution area has been reduced. New tools are necessary for assessing the management of these forests so they can adapt to the challenges to come. Our main goal was to evaluate the effects of different fuel treatments on Mediterranean Pinus nigra forests. We assessed the forest response, in terms of forest structure and fire behavior, to different intensities of low thinning treatments followed by different slash prescriptions (resulting in: light thinning and lop and scatter; light thinning and burn; heavy thinning and lop and scatter; heavy thinning and burn; and, untreated control). Treatments that used fire to decrease the resulting slash were the most effective for reducing active crown fires decreasing the rate of spread and flame length more than 89\%. Low thinning had an effect on torching potential, but there was no difference between intensities of thinning. Only an outcoming crown fire could spread actively if it was sustained by a high-enough constant wind speed and enough surface fuel load. Overall, treatments reduce fire intensity and treated areas have a more homogenous fire behavior response than untreated areas. This provides opportunities to extinguish the fire and reduce the probability of trees dying from the fire. It would be helpful to include ecological principles and fire behavior criteria in silvicultural treatment guidelines in order to perform more efficient management techniques in the future.},

Native pine forests, mainly Pinus pinaster and Pinus pinea have been occasionally affected by native bark beetles, cone feeders, one defoliator (the pine processionary moth) and a few fungi. Thus far, problems with these native pests and pathogens, arise mostly during outbreaks or epizootic periods. In most cases they are associated with poor forest management, fires or drought stress. Nevertheless, some alien pests and pathogens have recently become reason for concern, namely the pinewood nematode and Fusarium circinatum. Mediterranean forests composed of evergreen oaks, namely Quercus suber and Quercus ilex, were in the past mainly affected by defoliators such as Lymantria dispar and Tortrix viridana. During the second half of the 20th century, oak decline increased and was attributed to drought stress, together with a complex interaction of biotic agents. Fungi in the genera Biscogniauxia and Diplodia, the Oomycete Phytophthora cinnamomi together with bark and wood borers, in particular Platypus cylindrus, were associated with the most serious cases. For more than a century the exotic Eucalyptus forest plantations were free from pests and pathogens. However, they are currently threatened by increasing numbers of pests and diseases mainly originating from Australia. Some of them cause severe damage and compromise productivity. For all these forest ecosystems, health problems are expected to be favoured by climate changes and new biological invasions, implying that efforts should be made to develop new control strategies to combat future threats.},

                    Invasive tree pests are increasingly threatening forest ecosystems. Understanding and controlling their spread presents a major challenge for managers, researchers, and policy makers. In 1999, the pine wood nematode (PWN)
                    Bursaphelenchus xylophilus
                    , causal agent of pine wilt disease and native to North America, was first detected in Europe, more precisely in south‐western Portugal. Since then, it has spread to more than 30\% of the country, producing large‐scale damages in Portuguese forests.
                  
                
                
                  
                    We applied a new spatio‐temporal network‐based model to predict, at yearly intervals, the natural spread of the PWN on the Iberian Peninsula, as dispersed by the longhorn beetle
                    Monochamus galloprovincialis
                    , its only known vector in Europe. We compared the model predictions with independent observations of the natural spread of pine wilt disease in Portugal between 2005 and 2015. We simulated the effect of potential containment measures on the disease spread.
                  
                
                
                  The model predicted the status (infected or non‐infected) of forest areas with 93\% accuracy, had 93\% sensitivity and specificity, and AUC = 0.96 (averages for 8 years with validation data).
                
                
                  Simulated clear‐cut belts stopped the spread only if they were wider than 30 km, although thinner belts delayed invasion. Furthermore, clear‐cuts were much more effective in slowing down the invasion when reinforced, in the adjacent areas, by the reduction in the vector beetle population through mass trapping and by the early detection and removal of infected trees.
                
                
                  Model projections identified areas through which the nematode is most likely to invade, by natural means, the phytosanitary buffer zone established along the Portuguese border, and Spain.
                
                
                  
                    Synthesis and applications
                    . In the absence of effective containment measures, the pine wood nematode may naturally spread into Spain in about 5 years. In less than 10 years, it may reach the major forest and climatic corridors that provide a gateway for subsequent expansion towards the rest of the Iberian Peninsula and, in the longer term, towards other European countries. Our model can considerably support management efforts by forecasting when areas are at highest risk of vector‐mediated invasion as well as the effects of specific control measures on the disease spread.

                    Las especies invasoras suponen una amenaza creciente para los ecosistemas forestales. Comprender y controlar su expansión es un reto de primer orden para gestores, investigadores y responsables políticos. En 1999 el nematodo de la madera del pino (
                    Bursaphelenchus xylophilus
                    ), agente causante del decaimiento súbito del pino y originario de Norteamérica, fue detectado por primera vez en Europa, concretamente en el suroeste de Portugal. Desde entonces esta plaga se ha expandido a más del 30\% del territorio de Portugal y ha causado graves daños en los bosques portugueses.
                  
                
                
                  
                    En este estudio aplicamos un nuevo modelo espaciotemporal, basado en análisis de redes, para predecir anualmente la propagación natural del nematodo de la madera del pino en la península ibérica mediante la dispersión del cerambícido
                    Monochamus galloprovincialis
                    , su único vector conocido en Europa. Comparamos las predicciones del modelo con datos independientes sobre la expansión natural del área de distribución del nematodo observada en Portugal entre los años 2005 y 2015. Simulamos el efecto de diferentes posibles medidas de control en la expansión de esta plaga forestal.
                  
                
                
                  
                    El modelo predijo el estado (infectado o no infectado) de las áreas de bosque con una precisión del 93\%, tuvo una sensibilidad y especificidad del 93\%, y un
                    AUC
                    =0.96 (valores medios para los ocho años con datos de validación disponibles).
                  
                
                
                  Las cortas a hecho simuladas solo detuvieron la expansión de la plaga cuando se aplicaron en franjas con una anchura superior a los 30 km, aunque las cortas en franjas más estrechas retardaron el avance de la plaga. El retraso en la expansión de la plaga fue mucho mayor cuando las cortas a hecho se reforzaron, en las zonas adyacentes, con la reducción de la población del insecto vector mediante su captura masiva y con la detección temprana y eliminación de los árboles infectados.
                
                
                  Las predicciones del modelo identificaron las áreas a través de las que es más probable que el nematodo de la madera del pino invada, de manera natural, la zona tampón fitosanitaria establecida a lo largo de la frontera de Portugal y, más adelante, el territorio de España.
                
                
                  
                    Síntesis y aplicaciones
                    . Si no se aplican medidas de control efectivas, el nematodo de la madera del pino podría entrar de manera natural en España en unos 5 años. En menos de 10 años podría alcanzar los principales corredores que, por sus condiciones climáticas y de cobertura de bosque de coníferas, podrían facilitar su ulterior expansión hacia el resto de la península ibérica y, más a largo plazo, hacia otros países de Europa. Nuestro modelo puede proporcionar un apoyo sustancial a los esfuerzos de gestión mediante la identificación de las áreas con mayor riesgo de ser invadidas por el nematodo y mediante la evaluación del efecto de determinadas medidas de control en la expansión de esta plaga invasora.

	abstract = {Tree species mixtures can overyield monospecific stands and provide many other advantageous regulating and provisioning ecosystem services. So far, the effect of mixing on growth were mostly described at the individual tree level or cumulatively at the stand level. How overyielding emerges from the mixing pattern, how it is modulated by the current environmental conditions, and how overyielding develops with progressing stand age is largely unexplored. However, such knowledge might promote the silvicultural design of mixed stands. Here, we use 50 long-term experimental plots in Germany with repeated spatially explicit stand inventories. They cover monospecific and mixed species stands of Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), sessile oak (Quercus petraea [Matt.] Liebl.) and European beech, and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and European beech. The stands represent medium to very good site conditions, fully to moderately thinned 15–238 years-old stands with mixing patterns ranging from single-tree and group-mixture to monospecific stands. The main hypothesis is that mixing pattern, environmental conditions, and stand age modulate the stand growth and overyielding of mixed versus monospecific stands. Based on metrics of mixing the mixing pattern and indices of environmental conditions we show that mixed stands of European beech were on averaged by 12–36\% more productive than respective monocultures. Overyielding can increase with stand density, mixing degree, regularity of horizontal tree distribution, tree size variation, site index, and water supply. Overyielding continued throughout the whole rotation time. The found overyielding suggests general facilitative effects of mixing in terms of bioclimate or soil conditions, independent of the mixing pattern. In addition to this general effect, overyielding was increased by stand density and mixing degree. This suggests a strong competition reduction due to structural complementarity. That the overyielding increases in moist years, points to the competition reduction as dominant cause. We hypothesize that in moist years competition for light and nutrient becomes stronger, so that species complementarity is more important and competition reduction may operate stronger and more beneficial for growth than in years with growth limitation by water. The findings stress the relevance of spatially explicit approaches of analyzing and modelling facilitation and competition at the stand and tree level. Silvicultural prescriptions may incorporate the findings that the analyzed mixtures with European beech in general overyield monospecific stands and that the benefit can be further increased by stand density, mixing degree, and tree size variation. Beneficial effects of mixtures can be expected on medium to high quality sites, in dry years, and even more in moist periods.},

Maritime pine decline has been observed in several forests in the centre of the Iberian Peninsula, manifested as transparency at the crown, small needles, foliage discolouration and premature tree death. The aim of this study was to unravel the role of predisposing, inciting and contributing factors in Mediterranean maritime pine decline in Spain. Various parameters were measured in 27 circular plots of radius 15m in natural stands of P. pinaster ssp. mesogeensis. The data obtained indicated better forest health status in pure stands, in which thinning has been carried out, than in unthinned mixed stands. High values of total height and spring precipitation showed better forest health, whereas high tree density was associated with the poorest forest health status. The results suggest that predisposing factors such as competition and water deficit have triggered the decline of P. pinaster.},

Here we provide the current state of knowledge and future research directions with regards to 10 questions about mixed-forest functioning and management identified and selected by a range of European forest managers during an extensive participatory process. The set of 10 questions were the highest ranked questions from an online prioritization exercise involving 168 managers from 22 different European countries. In general, the topics of major concern for forest managers coincided with the ones that are at the heart of most research projects. They covered important issues related to the management of mixed forests and the role of mixtures for the stability of forests faced with environmental changes and the provision of ecosystem services to society. Our analysis showed that the current scientific knowledge about these questions was rather variable and particularly low for those related to the management of mixed forests over time and the associated costs. We also found that whereas most research projects have sought to evaluate whether mixed forests are more stable or provide more goods and services than monocultures, there is still little information on the underlying mechanisms and trade-offs behind these effects. Similarly, we identified a lack of knowledge on the spatio-temporal scales at which the effects of mixtures on the resistance and adaptability to environmental changes are operating. Our analysis may help researchers to identify what knowledge needs to be better transferred and to better design future research initiatives meeting practitioner’s concerns.},

In this study, we reviewed the scientific literature of the last 30 years to quantify the magnitude of projected changes in ecosystem services provision by Mediterranean forests under IPCC climate change scenarios. We classified the scenarios according to the temperature threshold of 2℃ set by the Paris Agreement (below or above). The review of 78 studies shows that climate change will lead to a general reduction in the provision of regulating services (e.g. carbon storage, regulation of freshwater quantity and quality) and a general increase in the number of fires, burnt areas and generally, an increase in climate-related forest hazards (median + 62\% by 2100). Studies using scenarios above the 2℃ threshold projected significantly more negative changes in regulating services than studies using scenarios below this threshold. Main projected trend changes on material services (e.g. wood products), were less clear and depended on (i) whether or not the studies considered the interaction between the rise in temperatures and other drivers (e.g. forest management, CO2 fertilization) and (ii) differences in productivity responses across the tree species evaluated. Overall, the reviewed studies projected significant reductions in range extent and habitat suitability for the most drought-sensitive forest species (e.g. −88\% Fagus sylvatica), while the amount of habitat available for more drought-tolerant species will remain stable or increase; however, the magnitude of projected change for these more xeric species was limited when high-end extreme climatic scenarios were considered (above Paris Agreement). Our review highlights the benefits that climate change mitigation (to keep global mean temperature increase {\textless}2℃) can bring in terms of service provision and conservation of Mediterranean forests.},

	abstract = {Forecasted scenarios of climate change are expected to result in a dramatic reduction in the provision of Ecosystem Services (ES) from forests. Increasing tree species diversity has been proposed as a measure for adapting forests and warrantee the provision of services, since mixed forests, if compared with monospecific forests, are expected to be more productive, resilient and stable facing disturbances. In the present work we use a modelling approach in order to quantify the provision of different ES under expected climate scenarios, comparing pure forests of Pinus pinea L. with mixed forests where the species grows accompanied by different Quercus and Juniperus species. To this aim we first adapted the existing individual tree level model PINEA2, originally constructed for pure even-aged stands of P. pinea, in order to consider the interspecific interactions acting in mixed forests. In a second step we used the so adapted model for forecasting and comparing the provision of different ES – focusing on stocking, growth, yield, CO2 fixation, economic income and structural diversity – under current climate and expected scenarios RCP 4.5 \& 8.5. Our results indicate that although growth and allometry in P. pinea trees is enhanced in mixtures, this effect is currently counterbalanced by the expected reduction in growth in the species occupying the understorey, thus under current climate conditions little differences due to composition are observed in the provision of ES. On the other hand, our simulations point to a generalized decrease in the ES supply under more severe climate change scenarios, being this reduction mitigated – at least in part - in mixed P. pinea forests, which are more competitive under the most restrictive environmental conditions. As a consequence, the promotion of mixtures by under-planting and/or releasing of pre-existing advanced regeneration of complementary species may be postulated as a management concept for adapting these forests to climate change.},
