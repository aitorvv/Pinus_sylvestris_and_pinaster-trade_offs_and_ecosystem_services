## :book: Abstract

Mixed forests are increasingly recognized for their resilience to climate change and enhanced ecosystem services (ESs) provision, making them a focal point for sustainable forest management strategies. This study examines the trade-offs in ESs provision between pure and different mixed stands proportions of Scots pine (*Pinus sylvestris* L.) and Maritime pine (*Pinus pinaster* Ait.) in the Northern Iberian Range, Spain. Using the SIMANFOR simulation platform, we evaluated various silvicultural scenarios developed to obtain different ESs such as carbon sequestration, timber and mushroom yields. Our findings reveal that ESs provision varies depending on the forest type (pure or mixed) and the mixture proportion, following different trends on each ES. The initial species proportions and their maintenance were less critical than the management approach itself, which significantly influenced ESs outcomes. Focusing solely on individual ESs can lead to trade-offs, as highlighted by our study on silviculture focused on big saw timber yields. However, adopting a balanced approach that considers multiple ESs can mitigate these trade-offs. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of this approach in maximizing yields of mushrooms, sequestered carbon, and small saw timber. This research provides valuable insights for forest managers aiming to balance productivity and sustainability in ESs provision, providing strategies to maximize compatible ESs effectively.
